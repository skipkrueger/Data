# Texas Historic Sales Tax Revenue Data

The two csv files represent net sales tax revenue for Texas cities for the dates and cities indicated. This data was provided directly from The Texas Comproller's Office, and needs quite a bit of cleaning up, which is the responsibility for the user. All questions about the data should be directed to the Texas Comproller, who is responsible for any sales tax data. No guarantees or warrantees regarding this data are made. This data is located here for the convenience of my colleagues and students only. It will not be updated - updates are available from the Texas Comptroller's website.
